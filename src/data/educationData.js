        date: 'March 21, 2025',
        author: 'Ana Morris',
        excerpt: 'In 1829, Mendelssohn made his first visit to Britain, to great acclaim. After a flurry of activity in London, he made his way to the Scottish capital and visited Holyrood Palace and Chapel. He wrote to his family describing the scene, "In the deep twilight we went today to the palace where Queen Mary lived and loved... Everything is ruined, decayed, and the clear heavens pour. I think I have found the beginnings of my \'Scottish Symphony\'." Also enclosed in this letter, was the music that would go on to be the very opening theme of the symphony. A sombre melody in the clarinets and violas, Mendelssohn seemingly struggled to recapture the drama of the Scottish landscape when he moved on to tour Italy and so the work was abandoned in 1831. We believe most of the work was done in 1841, and the Symphony was completed in Berlin in 1842. It maintains its Scottish flavour in places; moving into the scond movement, the prevalence of the Scotch Snap would seem to hint at Scottish folk tunes. The beautiful, flowing melody of the third is interrupted by a second theme, moreakin to a funeral march. It brings us back to a more sombre mood before we move into the vigorous and at times angular music of the fourth. Finally, at the end of the symphony, there is a lengthly majestic coda with a hymn-like melody.',

        date: 'Novermber 22, 2024',
        author: 'EUCO Committee',
        excerpt: 'Beethoven’s second symphony is remarkably cheerful given he was battling the inescapable decline of his hearing whilst composing it between 1801 & 1802. That being said, his inner turmoil seeps into the fabric of the music, in the form of fleeting moments of darkness and brutal sforzandos that intersperse smiling melodies. The nearly 3-minute-long introduction to the first movement is one of constant extremes – constant dynamic contrast, shifts between major and minor, hinting at the tonal structure of the entire symphony. However, this is followed by a typically jubilant Classical theme, driving the music forward. The gentle larghetto of the second movement is often intimate in its instrumentation. The development section introduces some unexpected harmonies hinting at Beethoven’s darkness but delicate chamber music returns. Instead of a gentle minuet and trio, Beethoven opts for a vibrant scherzo brimming with humour and cheeky characters. The trio begins with childish oboe melody – rudely interrupted by strings which ashamedly fade out, embarrassed at their behaviour. The final movement is decidedly jubilant – ending with a defiant coda with the trumpets and timpani. Or as a displeased Viennese critic of the time put it “a crass ogre, a stabbed, unbound writhing dragon that refuses to die, and although bleeding in the Finale, angrily beats about with tail erect.” Hopefully you are left with a better impression than this tonight. Beneath this outwardly joyous symphony is a composer struggling with a silent illness, whose complex emotions drive him to try and find a way to express himself in his music. This music is music of triumph and joy, and most importantly, a refusal to submit to despair.',
